    "# Rock Paper Scissors Game\n",
    "###  In this game, the player selects one input out of \"rock\", \"paper\", or \"scissors\" and the computer tracks the frequency of inputs in order to make an informed selection to optimize computer wins. The function, \"rock_paper_scissors\", takes player input and evaluates whether the round is a win, tie, or loss. The function, \"human bias\", tracks user bias so that the computer gets smarter as games go on."
